# cbr2cbz

A simple script to convert .cbr (rar-based) comic book archives to .cbz (zip-based) comic book archives.


## Requirements

- You must have **unrar** and **zip** installed.

- This is a BASH script. It assumes BASH is in **/bin**, so if you keep BASH elsewhere (like **/usr/local/bin** or **/usr/pkg/bin**)

- This is for Linux/BSD/Solaris systems. I cannot guarantee it will work on any other platform because I do not have access to them. It might work, but you may have to fix stuff to make it work right; if you do that, send me a patch and I'll gladly merge!
